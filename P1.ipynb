    "## Project: **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to implementing code, there is a brief writeup to complete. The writeup should be completed in a separate file, which can be either a markdown file or a pdf document. There is a [write up template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_template.md) that can be used to guide the writing process. Completing both the code in the Ipython notebook and the writeup template will cover all of the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view) for this project.\n",

    "My pipeline is essentially the same as the one in the lessons, with the only big change being that I replaced the initial grayscale image before the Canny edge detection with a color selection scheme to help weed out more false positives. This allowed me to simplify the Canny edge detector and Hough line segment detector parameters to get reasonable results though there's still room for improvement here. Specifically, there are three frames across the three videos that don't have lanes detected on one side or the other and so I have to hack around it by leveraging the inter-frame average. I display warnings for those frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the post-Hough line filtering, I looked at the lane lengths and used those as weights within each frame to decide which lines to extend, the idea being the longer lines right in front of the car are more reliable indicators of the current direction than something further out. And, then, to reduce jitter from frame to frame, I do a weighted average of the current frame with the last 8 frames, if they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to take on the challenge from the very outset and so I created still pictures of some useful scenes from the video and copied them into test_images. Realizing that the extents of the challenge pictures were different than the regular images, I knew I had to come up with a configurable region of interest (ROI). The only oddball thing was that the solidYellowLeft.mp4 video starts out with the left yellow lane much closer to the left edge of the frame than in the still images so calibrating the percentages to the stills didn't work initially and I had to expand the bottom part of the polygon to address the beginning of the video. There's clearly room for improvement in the technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staying with the ROI, I currently don't crop out the hoodline that's in the bottom of the frames in the challenge video. Doing some sort of average lane length and car edge detection to dynamically calculate the ROI would be useful. Even better would be a camera calibration operation before we start and possibly every once in a while if this is not a well mounted camera. This calibration could even correct for pitch and roll of the camera and rotate and/or crop the image appropriately. The same thing applies to finding the horizon line. Shouldn't be too hard, if I knew the right vision techniques, to find it automatically using OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond those items, where this algorithm can go wrong is with tight curves. To fix this, instead of using Hough to find lines, we'd need to somehow find splines to fit the lanes. This algorithm will also fail with any lane changes or white or yellow car changing lanes right in front of us (i.e., under the horizon). This may be fixable with a larger frame-to-frame average. Of course, to fix all of this the right way, one can imagine the ROI calculation, the Canny and Hough parameters, and the intra- and inter-frame averaging can be done much better with ML algorithms to improve them, but I'm sure that's what this class is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last comment about my code is that there are a lot of performanc issues. For one, the \"frame rate\" on my 12\" MacBook is about 20it/s which is just horrendous given I'm only detecing lane lines. This could be due to a variety of factors including running inside Jupyter, but I know this needs to be sped up by a factor of 10x or more. And then one thing I need to do is clean up the globals. Right now, a long video woudl just pile up and I really only need to keep the last 8 frames worth of line data but I didn't get around to doing that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in terms of the work required to do this, the algorithm itself was relatively easy and I think I had figured it out within 5-10 minutes of looking at this notebook. It then took me over 20 hours of work to get the algorithm implemented and tested. Most of this was fighting with setup issues, Python and library syntax, data types, image format issues, etc. The parameter tweaking probably only took me an hour in total. Hope future projects go easier than this one. What a learning experience for the first week."
